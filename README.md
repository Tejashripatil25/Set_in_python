# Set_in_python
A Set in Python programming is an unordered collection data type that is iterable, mutable and has no duplicate elements.

Sets are used to store multiple items in a single variable.

Set is one of 4 built-in data types in Python used to store collections of data, the other 3 are List, Tuple, and Dictionary, all with different qualities and usage.

A set is a collection which is unordered, unchangeable*, and unindexed.

Once a set is created, you cannot change its items, but you can remove items and add new items.

Sets are written with curly brackets.
Example:
Create a Set:

fruit = {"apple", "banana", "cherry"}

print(fruit)
